/*********************************************************************************
This table is to identify elevated blood pressure events. Elevated BP
events are identified by multiple combinatoral clinical endpoints 
comprising SBP above certain threshold and ICD diagnosis:
a) SBP >140 at current visit AND documented history of hypertension; or
b) SBP >140 at current visit and at another visit in last 18 months; or
c) SBP >160 at current visit 

For efficiency, it is recommended to perform computational 
phenotyping on a smaller cut of needed CDM tables only relevant to the 
eligible patient cohort. The study-specific CDM tables are usually 
saved in a separate Study_Schema preserving CDM relational database structure.
